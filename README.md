An intrusion refers to any unauthorized access, activity, or attempt to compromise the security of a computer system, network, or application. Intrusions can take various forms, including unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, denial-of- service attacks, and other malicious activities that violate the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems. Intrusions pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by potentially causing a range of harmful effects. These effects include unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, theft of intellectual property, financial losses, reputational damage, and the compromise of critical systems. Intrusions may also lead to the exploitation of vulnerabilities, the installation of malicious software, and unauthorized control over computer resources. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the ability to detect and respond to intrusions becomes crucial for maintaining the security and resilience of digital systems. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security mechanism designed to identify and respond to unauthorized or malicious activities within a computer system or network. The primary goal of an IDS is to detect potential security incidents in real-time or near- real-time, allowing administrators to take prompt action to mitigate the impact of intrusions. Traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems often struggle to adapt to the evolving nature of cyber threats. In this project, we leverage the Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble learning technique known for its efficacy in handling diverse and complex datasets.
